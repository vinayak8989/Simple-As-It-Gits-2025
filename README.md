## Module 1: Git Fundamentals & Local Workflow
### Concepts Covered:

- Version control basics

- Repository initialization

- Staging/Committing

- Change tracking

```bash
CLI Commands:
git init
git status
git add <file>            # Stage specific file
git add .                 # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Message"
git log
git diff
```

### Installation & Initial Configuration

> [Use the official website](https://git-scm.com/) to download git

Setting up the global identity

```bash
# Configure author name
git config --global user.name "Alex Johnson"

# Configure author email
git config --global user.email "alex@example.com"
```

### Exercise:

1. Create a project folder with mkdir

```bash
mkdir my-first-git-repo
cd my-first-git-repo
```

2. Initialize Git repo

```bash
git init
```

3. Create README.md and write something

```bash
code README.md
```

4. Stage & commit

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "My first commit"
```

5. Check Log

```bash
git log
```

6. Modify README.md then check status & diff

```bash
git status
git diff
```
7. Stage, commit all changes and check log

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git log
```

## Module 2: Branching & Merging

### Concepts Covered:

- Working with isolated branches

- Merging changes back to main

- Fast-forward vs. 3-way merges

- Resolving merge conflicts

```bash

CLI Commands:
git branch                     # List all branches
git branch <name>             # Create a new branch
git switch <branch>           # Switch to an existing branch
git switch -c <new-branch>    # Create and switch to a new branch
git merge <branch>            # Merge given branch into current branch
```

Exercise:
1. Create a new branch and switch to it
```bash
git switch -c feature-1       # '-c' creates the new branch and 'switch' command switches to it.
```
> You're now working on a new isolated branch named feature-1.

2. Make some change in the file and commit
```bash
git add feature.txt           # stages the file
git commit -m "Add feature 1" # commits the change
```

3. Switch back to the main branch
```bash
git switch main               # switches command switches it to main branch
```

4. Make some other conflicting change in the same file
```bash
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Main branch change"
```

5. Try to merge feature-1 into main
```bash
git merge feature-1           # merges the 2 branches
```
> Since both branches changed the same file, Git will report a merge conflict.

6. Resolve the conflict manually
Open the conflicted file (e.g, feature.txt). It will look like this:

```txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is main branch change
=======
This is feature 1
>>>>>>> feature-1
```
Edit the file to resolve the conflict:

```txt
This is main branch change
This is feature 1
```

7. Stage the resolved file and commit
```bash
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict between main and feature-1"
```

Bonus Tip: Delete a branch (after merging)
Once you've successfully merged a feature branch, you can delete it to keep your repo clean:

```bash
git branch -d feature-1
```
> Use -D instead of -d to force delete if it's not merged yet. ^_~

## Module 3: GitHub Integration
### Concepts Covered:

- Remote repositories

- Push/Pull workflow

- Clone vs. Fork
```bash
CLI Commands:

bash
git remote add origin <URL>     # Link local ↔ remote
git push -u origin main         # First push (set upstream)
git push                        # Subsequent pushes
git pull                        # Fetch + merge
git clone <URL>
```
### Exercise:

1. Create GitHub repo (no README/license)
Create an account on GitHub
Initialize a repository 
    
2. Connect local repo to GitHub
reference: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):[Press enter]
```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile picture, then click  Settings.

In the left sidebar: Access > SSH and GPG keys

Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.

In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key.

In the "Key" field, paste what was copied from the clip command

Click Add SSH key.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepository.git
```
4. Push branches
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
If your local branch is named master, use:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

NOTE:
```git push``` uploads your commits to the remote repository for the branch you’re currently working in.

5. Clone a partner's repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:partnerusername/their-repo-name.git
```   

## Module 4: Collaboration Workflow
### Concepts Covered:

- Pull Requests (GitHub UI)

- Fetching changes

- Upstream tracking
  
```bash
CLI Commands:

bash
git fetch                        # Check remote changes
git merge origin/main            # Merge fetched changes
git pull --rebase                # Rebase instead of merge
git push --force-with-lease      # Safely overwrite history
```
### Exercise:

1. Simulate team collaboration:

2. Partner A: Push commit to main

3. Partner B: git fetch → git merge

4. Create PR via GitHub, review diff

5. Resolve merge conflict via CLI

## Module 5: Undoing Changes
### Concepts Covered:

- Commit history rewriting

- Stashing temporary work

```bash
CLI Commands:

bash
git restore <file>              # Discard uncommitted changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1         # Undo commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1         # ⚠️ Destroy last commit
git revert <commit-hash>        # Safe undo for shared history
git stash                       # Temporary shelf
```

### Exercise:

1. Undo and recommit
-Make a change and commit it
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
-Modify the file and recommit the updated change

2. Discard Broken Code
-intentionally break a file
-Discard changes with:
```bash
git restore <file>
```

3. Revert a pushed commit
-Identify the hash of a commit already pushed
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
-Push the reverted commit to remote
```bash
git push
```

4. Use git stash
-Make uncommitted changes
```bash
git stash
```
-switch branches of perform other tasks
-reapply the changes with:
```bash
git stash pop
```

## Module 6: Advanced Practices
### Concepts Covered:

- .gitignore patterns

- Tagging releases

- Rebasing vs. merging

```bash
CLI Commands:

bash
# .gitignore patterns
*.log
temp/
git tag v1.0                  # Release tagging
git rebase main               # Reapply commits on updated base
git cherry-pick <commit>      # Grab specific commit
```
